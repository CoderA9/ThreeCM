 Freezable operations are serialized when the network goes down and restored when the connectivity is up again.

 LXNetworkKit doesn't freeze (readonly) GET operations even if they are marked as freezable

 Sets the `completionBlock` property with a block that executes either the specified success or failure block, depending on the state of the request on completion.

 @param success The block to be executed on the completion of a successful request. This block has no return value and takes two arguments: the receiver operation and the object constructed from the response data of the request.
 @param failure The block to be executed on the completion of an unsuccessful request. This block has no return value and takes two arguments: the receiver operation and the error that occured during the request.
 
 @discussion This method should be overridden in subclasses in order to specify the response object passed into the success block.
